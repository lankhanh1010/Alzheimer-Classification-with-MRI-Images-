Presentation Summary (item 8) 

From a business and introduction standpoint, our team assumed the role of a consulting group with a local hospital tasked with exploring their Alzheimer MRI Images by leveraging advanced artificial intelligence models and techniques to classify Alzheimer’s disease into four distinct stages. Model classification may help in identifying the progression of the disease enabling healthcare professionals at the hospital to provide targeted care and interventions.
