# üß† Alzheimer Classification with MRI Images  
In Memory of My Late Grandmother, who battled Alzheimer's

This project explored Alzheimer's disease classification using MRI images by leveraging advanced deep learning techniques. The model classified MRI scans into four distinct stages of Alzheimer's disease, potentially aiding healthcare professionals in early detection, monitoring disease progression, and optimizing patient care.

## üìÇ Dataset Overview  
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Source:**
- Best Alzheimer MRI dataset (99% accuracy) 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lukechugh/best-alzheimer-mri-dataset-99-accuracy

- Each MRI image is labeled into one of the following categories:  
  - Non-Demented: Healthy brain images  
  - Very Mild Demented: Early signs of Alzheimer‚Äôs  
  - Mild Demented: Moderate progression  
  - Moderate Demented: Advanced stage  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Class Distribution (Before SMOTE):**  
- Non-Demented: 640 samples  
- Very Mild Demented: 448 samples  
- Mild Demented: 179 samples  
- Moderate Demented: 12 samples

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Dataset Imbalance:**  
The dataset was highly imbalanced, which could affect model performance. To address this, we applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance the class distribution.

## üèó Methodology  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Baseline Training on Unbalanced Data**  
- The first step involved training a base model using InceptionV3, ResNet152v2, and DenseNet201 with the given imbalance dataset.
- Extracted feature embeddings (Zcode) from the trained models, forming Zcode_training and Zcode_testing


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **SMOTE Application for Class Balancing**  
- Instead of generating synthetic images, SMOTE was applied to Zcode_training and Zcode_testing to balance class distributions.
- The training dataset was adjusted to ensure that each category contained the same number of samples (2560 samples).


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Final Model Training on Balanced Data**  
- The final classifier was trained using the SMOTE-balanced dataset with extracted features from step 2.
- Evaluated performance using test data without SMOTE to measure real-world applicability.
